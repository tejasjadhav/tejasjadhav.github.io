Have you ever read a fantasy story which was so amazing that you regretted not being a part of? For me, it's Skypiea from One Piece.

I am fan of J. R. R. Tolkien and his world building prowess. If you thought Lord of the Rings was detailed enough, wait until you read Silmarillion which talks about creation of Arda (the world of LOTR), its mythology, revelations of mighty characters and their lineages (House of Beor, Noldorian elves, Numenors, etc.), history of all evil (Morgoth, Balrogs, Dragons, etc.) and the consequential story of the Silmarils. I was always in awe with the depth as well as the breadth of Tolkien's work. Then, around 3 years back, I started watching One Piece by Eiichiro Oda. I wasn't impressed at first but, after the Arlong Park arc, I began to acknowledge the character building and story telling in One Piece.

Then came Skypiea. I still consider it as Oda's finest example in terms of world building. You can check out [Craftsdwarf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMG_DhlUf6UXgSaFfS6JD1g)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sdORk7V-Do) which delineates how impressively Skypiea was constructed.

<small>Craftsdwarf's video highlights one the core reasons why Skypiea is so amazing</small>

I will discuss this in two parts. First I will explain what makes this one so special and second, I will highlight a few amazing moments from the arcs.

> **SPOILER ALERT:** I will be exploring a lot of One Piece content. If you have never watched One Piece before, I would strongly suggest at least finishing till the Skypiea arc before reading on. You can continue at your own risk, if you want to.

# What made Skypiea special

## The build up gives us mysteries to ponder over

The Sky Island saga is build up of two arcs - Jaya arc and Skypiea arc. Though Skypiea is where all the thrill happens, it is the Jaya arc which I appreciate the most. I will just highlight a few points here,

### Lot of major character introductions

First comes Robin aka _Miss All Sunday_, the villain from the Alabasta arc and Crocodile's second in command (I guess). For the first time, we see an antagonist willingly switching sides and getting into the main crew. Though her introduction and initial interaction with the crew members is hilarious, there's still an air of mystery around her. An archeologist and an assassin with a bounty of 79 million berries at a mere age of eight, she's definitely one of the most powerful crew members whose true strength is yet to be revealed.

Then comes the revelations of the most interesting pirate group in the entire One Piece universe. An amazing sniper who manages to shoot down a bird not even visible to human eye, a mad wrestler who plummets even the most hardened pirates on the island, an old sick man who offers explosive apples to people, and a big fat guy who talks about fate and shares Luffy's idea of pursuing dreams and not giving up. Who would know these guys would dramatically change the entire course of the One Piece world in future?

We further get to know about a guy named Montblanc Noland. He was a botanist and an adventurer who had explored the whole One Piece world. His adventures were so thrilling and captivating that it was difficult to tell apart whether he really travelled or just spewing blatant lies. His death is also one of the most tragic ones wherein he gets executed by his king for lying about the gold treasure on Jaya island. Montblanc Noland would eventually become one of the most referenced characters in the story.

### Geographical phenomena

In the entire series so far, no arc has ever explored so much about the geographical aspects of the One Piece world than this one. Let's talk about a few of these concepts.

* **Knock-up streams:** When water pockets trapped under sea heat up due to geothermal heat, it boils and once enough pressure accumulates, it causes a violent undersea explosion. The impact can propagate to the surface and shoot huge water column into the sky. I loved this simple explanation for such a fictional phenomenon and it looks plausible.
* **Island clouds:** When a sea stone element is trapped inside water vapor, it forms island cloud. Depending on its density, it either forms an island cloud or a sea cloud. The fact that it contains sea stone element makes up a good explanation why these clouds are sturdy enough to bear the weight of the sky islands and also why devil fruit users feel powerless when they "drown" in the sea cloud.
* **Sky island biology:** Owing to far lesser air pressure, any being coming from the ground would find it difficult adjusting to this new environment. Also, beings on Jaya which landed on Sky Island four hundred years back got adapted to this new and thinner atmosphere and instead got inflated - birds, fish, trees are super big (though I wonder why the Shandians didn't get big).

## Lots of areas are left open to be explored afterwards
