I recently came across [a thread](http://www.arlongpark.net/showthread.php?t=38320) stating the similarity between [One Piece (anime and manga)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) by Eiichiro Oda and [The Dark Knight Rises movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises) by Christopher Nolan.
